Sustainable nutrition is an essential approach to ensuring global food security, environmental protection, and public health. It focuses on dietary patterns that have a low environmental impact while promoting optimal health and well-being for present and future generations. Key sustainable diet models such as the Mediterranean, Nordic, DASH, and vegetarian/vegan diets emphasize plant-based foods, seasonal and local produce, reduced meat consumption, and minimal processed foods. These models not only support human health but also significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions, water usage, and land degradation.
Alternative protein sources are increasingly vital in addressing sustainability concerns. Plant-based proteins (like legumes, soy, and nuts), single-cell proteins (derived from algae, fungi, and bacteria), and edible insects are emerging as efficient, eco-friendly substitutes to traditional animal proteins. They require fewer resources and generate less environmental harm.
Despite the benefits, global adoption of sustainable diets faces several barriers. Limited awareness, economic constraints, accessibility issues, and cultural resistance to alternative foods hinder progress. Overcoming these challenges requires coordinated efforts in public education, policy-making, and innovation in food production. Promoting sustainable nutrition is not just a health strategy but a critical response to climate change and environmental degradation.
